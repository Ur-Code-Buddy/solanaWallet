# Solana Crypto Wallet

Welcome to the Solana Crypto Wallet! This is a secure, feature-rich wallet application built on the Solana blockchain, allowing you to manage multiple wallets, send/receive funds, and verify transactions directly on the blockchain. 

## Features

- **Create Multiple Wallets:** Generate as many wallets as you need, all linked to a single mnemonic phrase for easy management.

- **View Balances:** Check the balance of each wallet in real-time.
- **Verify Transactions:** Confirm and track your transactions directly on the Solana blockchain.
